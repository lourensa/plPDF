Description: This package makes calculations with random variables, defined by piecewise linear 
   probabilitye density functions (PL-PDFs), feasible.
   This includes the creation of PL-PDFs, arthmetic binary operations (+-\times /), and elementary functions like \code{log()} and \code{exp()}. The PL-PDF objects are implemented as an S3 object class (plpdf), and methods for generic functions are supplied. Herewith, the dispatch mechanism of R is available, which makes the use of the functionality very intuitive.
